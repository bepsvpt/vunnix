# Extensions

Each extension has one canonical folder:

- `ext-###-slug/assessment.md`
- `ext-###-slug/plan.md`

Rules:
- Keep assessment and plan in the same extension folder.
- Do not write new extension plans into legacy `docs/archive/plans-legacy/` paths.
- Keep extension IDs sequential (`ext-001`, `ext-002`, ...).
