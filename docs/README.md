# Documentation

This repository uses a canonical documentation layout to keep generated artifacts easy to find and correlate.

## Structure

- `docs/guides/`: onboarding and environment setup guides.
- `docs/reference/`: durable technical references (architecture, specs, API references).
- `docs/operations/`: operational runbooks, audits, and automation workflows.
- `docs/work/`: implementation work artifacts generated by extension workflows.
- `docs/archive/`: legacy or historical artifacts kept for traceability.

## Work Artifact Convention

Tier 2-3 extension artifacts are co-located in one folder:

- `docs/work/extensions/ext-###-slug/assessment.md`
- `docs/work/extensions/ext-###-slug/plan.md`

Tier 1 assessments are stored in:

- `docs/work/tier1/<slug>/assessment.md`

## Validation

Run `scripts/docs/check-work-items.sh` to validate extension folder naming and required files.
