# Vunnix dogfooding — AI-powered reviews on this repo's GitLab mirror.
#
# Uses include:local since this repo contains the CI template itself.
# The vunnix-review job only runs when triggered by the Vunnix Task Dispatcher
# (VUNNIX_TASK_ID is set). Regular pushes and MRs do NOT trigger this job.
#
# Full CI (tests, linting, builds) runs on GitHub Actions (.github/workflows/).
